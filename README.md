# Readable Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Redux course.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

For running the project locally, you will need the Readable API Server. You can find it [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).
